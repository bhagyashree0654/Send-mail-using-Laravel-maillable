This application enables the student to fill the mentor form anywhere online. To fill the form, the student has to register and create an account. After creating an account student has to login into the system and fill the mentor form. This application then sends an email to the corresponding mentor email-id from the website mail with the details of the student who filled the form. After the successful form submission, it redirects to the dashboard and students can log out of the system.
